    <h1>Blue Ocean</h1>
    <p>Blue Ocean is a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modelling and presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information thatâ€™s important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still staying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.</p>
     <p>Blue Ocean also incorporates "The Jenkins Design Language (JDL)" which is a standardized set of components and a style guide that help developers create plugins which effortlessly retain the look and feel of the Blue Ocean user experience.</p>
