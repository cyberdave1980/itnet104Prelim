    <h1>Infrastructure</h1>
    <p>As an independent open source project, Jenkins maintains most of its own infrastructure including services which help keep the project running. The kinds of things that fall into "infrastructure" can span from operating virtual machines and distribution networks, to project-specific applications developed to make the development of Jenkins core and plugins more efficient.</p>
