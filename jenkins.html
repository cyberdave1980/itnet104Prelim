    <h1>Document Jenkins in Kubernetes</h1>
    <p>Kubernetes is a platform-agnostic container orchestration tool created by Google and heavily supported by the open-source community as a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.</p>
    <p>Jenkins on Kubernetes is a popular theme for Jenkins users. There are a lot of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, however, thereâ€™s currently no central location for documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes. This project would create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.</p>
